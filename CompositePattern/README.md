## Composite Pattern
Structural design pattern

The Composite design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects to be arranged in trees so that they can be treated as individual objects.

This pattern provides a framework for designing a composition of objects whose depth is unknown (we can use a tree as an analogy).

The "clients" interact with the objects without knowing the structure of the tree.![](../images/composite.png)![](../images/composite_generique.png)
