## Decorator pattern
Patrons de cr√©ation


This pattern allows to DYNAMICALLY add ADDITIONAL functionalities to an object without modifying the interface of the object ("the clients of the object are not aware of the modification").

This is an alternative to the creation of a subclass that would allow to enrich the object.
